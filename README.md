# File Explorer Component

## Overview

This project is a simple **File Explorer Component** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **CSS**. It simulates a file system where users can navigate through folders, view files, and interact with files using a context menu. 

## Features

- **Folder Navigation**: Folders can be expanded or collapsed to view their contents.
- **File Selection**: Clicking on a file will toggle its selected state, indicating that it is active.
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Right-clicking on a file opens a custom context menu with the following options:
  - **Copy**: Logs a message to the console indicating that the file has been copied.
  - **Delete**: Logs a message to the console indicating that the file has been deleted.
  - **Rename**: Logs a message to the console indicating that the file has been renamed.
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS animations are used to expand folders and improve the appearance of the context menu.
- **Icon Usage**: SVG icons are used for different file types like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, images, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: This is for building the UI and managing the state.
- **TypeScript**: This is for type safety and better developer experience.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and adding animations.
- **Flexbox & Grid**: Utilized for layout and positioning of file/folder items and context menu.
- **No External Libraries**: The project is built without using any third-party libraries (e.g., no `styled-components` or other UI libraries).
